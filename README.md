Enigma-Inspired Password Suggestion App
A simple frontend-only project that demonstrates how password suggestions can be generated using logic inspired by the Enigma machine. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this app allows users to register with a custom password or generate a secure one using a simulated rotor-based encryption system.

Project Files:

register.html: User registration form page

register.js: Contains Enigma logic, password suggestion generator, and form handling

style.css: General styling for the webpage

style1.css: Additional styling for the registration form

Features:

Enigma-inspired password suggestion using rotors, plugboard, and reflectors

Form validation (minimum password length: 8 characters)

Fully browser-based (no backend or server required)

Useful for understanding encryption logic and DOM manipulation

How to Use:

Open register.html in any web browser

Enter a username

Choose to either:

Enter your own password (at least 8 characters), or

Click the "Suggest Password" button to generate one automatically

Click "Register"

Disclaimer:
This project is intended for educational purposes only.
The Enigma logic is a simplified simulation and should not be used for real-world password encryption.
No data is saved or storedâ€”everything runs locally in the browser.
