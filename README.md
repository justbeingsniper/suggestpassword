# Enigma-Inspired Password Suggestion App

A browser-based registration form that generates secure passwords using simplified Enigma machine logic. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project simulates historical rotor-based encryption for educational purposes.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how classic encryption concepts, like the Enigma machine, can be adapted to create a custom password suggestion system. It allows users to register with a username and either enter their own password or generate one using the Enigma-based logic.

## Features

- Password suggestion based on Enigma-style rotor and reflector logic
- Simple user registration form with frontend validation
- Minimum password length enforced (8 characters)
- No backend — all logic runs entirely in the browser
- Great for learning encryption fundamentals and DOM manipulation

## File Structure

- `register.html` – Registration form and UI
- `register.js` – Core logic for password suggestion and form handling
- `style.css` – Base styles for the UI
- `style1.css` – Additional styles for form layout and design

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `register.html` in your browser.
3. Enter a username.
4. Choose to:
   - Enter a custom password (min. 8 characters), or
   - Click **"Suggest Password"** to generate a strong password automatically.
5. Click **"Register"**.

## Disclaimer

This application is for educational purposes only.  
The Enigma-based logic is a simplified simulation and **not secure for real-world use**.  
No data is stored — all activity is performed locally in the browser.
