# Enigma_SuggestPassword

Enigma-Inspired Password Suggestion App
A simple frontend-only project that demonstrates how password suggestions can be generated using logic inspired by the Enigma machine. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this app allows users to register with a custom password or generate a secure one using a simulated rotor-based encryption system.
